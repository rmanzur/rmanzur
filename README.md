- Here is a fun knowledge graph (sort of resembling a tree 🌴) representing courses I took in graduate school and the connections between them: unidirectional arrows point in the direction of a course providing foundational knowledge for another course, and bidirectional arrows indicate that key concepts in both courses/fields interact in significant ways. The color of the courses/nodes represent whether a course is domain-driven and applied (green), tool-driven and applied (crimson), or theoretical/foundational (brown)
